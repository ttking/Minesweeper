# Minesweeper

This was a school assignment where we had to make minesweeper within a week as to learn how a flood fill algorithm worked, I made the flood fill system with fitting art for minesweeper but in the end didn't have the time to add the ability to flag mines.
Nonetheless I completed the assignment recently and learned a bit more about algorithms.
